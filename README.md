# What is deal machine?

Before I became a software engineer, I helped write and negotiate SOWs for a SaaS company. If you ever worked in sales, you that the period between a verbal agreement and the actual signing of a contract is filled with anxiety, confusion, chaos, and generalized mayhem. Deal machine will change this. Deal machine will not let you down.
